<h1>HTML5 Audio Test Page</h1>

<p>This is a temporary test page, while I work out how to add HTML5 audio tag support to this website.</p>

In theory, you should be able to play the above song natively in Firefox 3.5+ (Ogg format), Safari 4 and Google Chrome/Chromium (MP3 format); many older browsers, and all versions of Internet Explorer and Opera should play the song using a Flash player. Browsers with Flash and/or Javascript switched off will show a warning, and a link to the MP3 file.
</p>
<p>
On my computer, Chrome is far and away the fastest browser--the file is loaded and ready to play almost instantly--followed by Firefox 3.7a1pre (<abbr>AKA</abbr> "Minefield").
<p>
In case you're interested, the source code looks like this (I'm using the <a href="http://wpaudioplayer.com/standalone">this</a> Flash audio player):
</p>
{% highlight html %}
<audio controls autobuffer>
<source src="song.ogg" />
<source src="song.mp3" />
<p id="audioplayer_1">
It looks like you have JavaScript and/or Flash switched off:
switch them on and reload to play this file,
or <a href="song.mp3">download it here</a>.
</p>
<script type="text/javascript">  
AudioPlayer.embed("audioplayer_1", {soundFile: "song.mp3"});  
</script>
</audio>
