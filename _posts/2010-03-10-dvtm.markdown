I may have been spending too much time on the Eee PC lately. The iTerm window you see above is split using [dvtm](http://www.brain-dump.org/projects/dvtm/), a brilliant little utility that brings the features of a tiling window manager to your terminal. It works particularly well with a tabbed terminal emulator, and/or the likes of [screen](http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/screen/)  and [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/ "A terminal multiplexer, which I find a lot easier to use than the venerable screen").
