"A 12 page newsprint periodical collecting and collating the best of literature from travel guides, treatises, pamphlets, books, receipts and ephemera. Each looks through the lens "of to-day", revelling in the present and present history, whether from the 18th Century or the 20th." Made with [Newspaper Club](http://www.newspaperclub.co.uk/).
