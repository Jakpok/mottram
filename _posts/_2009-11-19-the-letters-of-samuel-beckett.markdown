I'm about halfway through _<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0521867932?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=submirespo-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0521867932">The Letters of Samuel Beckett: Volume I, 1929&#8212;1940</a>_. It's the first in a four volume edition<sup id="f1"><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>, and it's a complete bloody joy to read.

This is because Beckett, even when dashing off a quick note to a mate, constantly experiments with language. He coins neologisms, crashing French into German into English (sometimes in the same _word_), and flits from scatalogical flights that would make Malcolm Tucker blush--the practice of writing is constantly compared to the act of pooing--to beautifully rude dismissals of the writers he's reading<sup id="f2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>. Being Beckett, he is of course reading constantly, and constantly lifting phrases and imagery whoever crosses his path--all these letters serve, consciously or otherwise, as a rehearsal for 'real' writing<sup id="f3"><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>, which Beckett relentlessly complains is impossible, and they certainly foreshadow the switch from English to French which enabled the writer to write his plays and novels.

The only sour note is the sense that we readers are missing out on material collected by Fehsenfeld, Overbeck <span class="amp">&amp;</span> co.. Beckett's permission to publish his correspondence only applied to letters 'having bearing on <span>[his]</span> work', which the editors, quite rightly, took to mean 'pretty much everything'. The notoriously prickly Beckett estate didn't quite agree, so, if you're looking for literary tittle-tattle about <abbr>SB</abbr>'s fling with Peggy Guggenheim, or the rejection of Lucia Joyce's advances (which I admit I sort of was), you're out of luck.

If you're a fan<sup id="f4"><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>, this is already on your Christmas list, I'm sure. If you're _not_ a fan, this volume might well change your mind--here Beckett is thoroughly accessible, often charming, not words familiar to those who've banged their heads against his published works!

<ol>
<li id="n1">Beckett might be famously terse, in much of his writing and in his public life, but privately, he was a right chatterbox: the editors have whittled the available letters down to &#8216;just&#8217; 15,000 for these four volumes, and the foot- and endnotes refer to, or quote, countless more. <a href="#f1">&#8617;</a></li>
<li id="n2">Proust in particular gets it in the neck, his writing dismissed at one point as &#8220;a maudlin false teeth gobble-gobble discharge from a colic-afflicted belly&#8221;. Aldous Huxley&#8217;s <em>Point Counter Point</em>, meanwhile, is dismissed as &#8216;Cunt Counter Cunt&#8217;. <a href="#f2">&#8617;</a></li>
<li id="n3">In this respect, Beckett is a bit like Burroughs (though in the latter's case, the letters to Ginsberg are far, far better than the fiction that followed). <a href="#f3">&#8617;</a></li>
<li id="n4">I am, and have been since school. Which unfortunately means I can't read <em>Endgame</em> without cringing at the memory of a fifth form mini-production of the play, in which I took the r&#244;le of Nag (or maybe Nell), stuffed in a plastic dustbin. <a href="#f4">&#8617;</a></li>
