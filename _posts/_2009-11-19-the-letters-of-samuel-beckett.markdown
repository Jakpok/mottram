I'm about halfway through _<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0521867932?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=submirespo-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0521867932">The Letters of Samuel Beckett: Volume I, 1929&#8212;1940</a>_. It's the first in a four volume edition<sup id="f1"><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>, and I cannot bloody wait for the next three.

This is because Beckett, even when dashing off a quick note to a mate, can't help but experiment with language. He coins new words, shows off odd archaisms, crashes French into German into English (sometimes in the same _word_). And he flits from scatalogical flights of fancy that would make Malcolm Tucker blush--writing is constantly compared to having a good solid _merde_--to beautifully rude dismissals of the writers he's reading<sup id="f2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>. He is, of course, reading constantly, at fever pitch (though not _too_ widely) and filching phrases and images from whoever crosses his path, Austen even--he calls her 'the divine Jane'!

Reading the letters, it's hard to avoid the feeling that Beckett is in rehearsal, quite consciously, and limbering up for his 'real' writing<sup id="f3"><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>, which he complains is impossible, unbearable. And there's no doubt that these letters foreshadow, messily, Beckett's switch from English to French, and explain, over time, why he _needed_ a second language in which to write his plays and novels.

The only sour note is the sense that we readers are missing out on material that Fehsenfeld, Overbeck <span class="amp">&amp;</span> co. have enjoyed. Beckett's permission to publish his correspondence only applied to letters 'having bearing on <span>[his]</span> work', which the editors, quite rightly, took to mean 'pretty much everything'. The notoriously prickly Beckett estate didn't agree. So, if you're looking for literary tittle-tattle (which I admit I was), you're out of luck: there's nowt about <abbr>SB</abbr>'s fling with Peggy Guggenheim, nor his decision to spurn poor Lucia Joyce, save hints here and there in the editors' notes.

If you're a fan<sup id="f4"><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>, the _Letters_ are already on your Christmas list, I'm sure. If you're _not_ a fan, this volume might well change your mind--here Beckett is thoroughly accessible, often charming, not words familiar to those who've banged their heads against his published works!

<ol>
<li id="n1">Beckett might be famously terse, in much of his writing and in his public life, but privately, he was a right chatterbox: the editors have whittled the available letters down to &#8216;just&#8217; 15,000 for these four volumes, and the foot&#8211; and endnotes refer to, or quote, another 5<abbr title="thousand">K</abbr> or so. <a href="#f1">&#8617;</a></li>
<li id="n2">Proust really gets it in the neck, dismissed as &#8220;a maudlin false teeth gobble-gobble discharge from a colic-afflicted belly&#8221;. More pithily, Aldous Huxley&#8217;s <em>Point Counter Point</em> gets a more basic treatment, dubbed &#8216;Cunt Counter Cunt&#8217;. <a href="#f2">&#8617;</a></li>
<li id="n3">In this respect, Beckett is a bit like Burroughs (though in the latter's case, the letters to Ginsberg are far, far better than the fiction that followed). <a href="#f3">&#8617;</a></li>
<li id="n4">I am, and have been since school. Which unfortunately means I can't read <em>Endgame</em> without cringing at the memory of a fifth form mini-production of the play, in which I took the r&#244;le of Nag (or maybe Nell), stuffed in a plastic dustbin. <a href="#f4">&#8617;</a></li>
