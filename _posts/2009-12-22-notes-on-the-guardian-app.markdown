> My focus was on to how to take what is essentially an RSS fed app and leverage the layers of content in that feed to give more depth at every stage.

John-Henry Barac on the evolution of the Guardian iPhone app. He succeeded in adding that depth, I think. The app has quickly replaced [Byline][1] as my default short-term boredom-averter (in queues, the backs of cabs, &c.). It's great for quick skimming, but it also draws you in towards content you aren't actively looking for, like a proper newspaper does--I now read the Guardian in print, on the iPhone, in [NetNewsWire][2] and on the web, in that order.
