I hate the _Sun_, for [obvious reasons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_Disaster#The_Sun_newspaper_controversy "That, and Page 3, and 'Gotcha', and Murdoch, and its far-right politics, and..."), but new editor Dominic Mohan's editorial, '[Don't You Know There's a Bloody War On](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/campaigns/our_boys/2611351/Dont-you-know-theres-a-bloody-war-on.html)' is worth a read.

On the surface it's the usual anti-Brown, pro-troops fluff, blaming the forces' lack of success in Afghanistan on underfunding. But under the surface, it looks awfully like a preamble to the unthinkable: the _Sun_ taking an explicit anti-war stance.
