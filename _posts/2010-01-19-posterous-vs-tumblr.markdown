Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry is dead on when it comes to the front pages of the two services: Posterous needs to simplify, and should move away from the 'just send an email' sign-up process.

<p class="small">I don't use either, but having tinkered with both I much prefer Posterous. The walled garden of 'following, 'liking' and 'reblogging' features on Tumblr put me off, while Posterous' posting via email (to multiple services, including Tumblr) is a brilliant idea, and well excecuted.</p>
