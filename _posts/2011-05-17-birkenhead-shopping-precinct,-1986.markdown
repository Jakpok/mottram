From [D-block GB-328000-387000][1] of the [Domesday Project][2], now available online, after years languishing on LV-ROM discs that could only be read by a [BBC Master][3] and a bespoke laserdisc player.

_Update_: For the next few days, you can listen to Radio 4's [history of the Domesday Project][4], and the digital archeology required to rescue it.
