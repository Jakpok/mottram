> Of all the varieties of irritating comment out there, the absolute most annoying has to be "Why can’t you just watch the movie for what it is??? Why can’t you just enjoy it? Why do you have to _analyze_ it???" If you have posted such a comment, or if you are about to post such a comment, here or anywhere else, let me just advise you: Shut up. Shut the fuck up. Shut your goddamn fucking mouth. SHUT. UP.
