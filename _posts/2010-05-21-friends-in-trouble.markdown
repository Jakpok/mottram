A stunning thread at Ask MetaFilter in which user fake asks for help in getting two friends out of a very sticky situation--they're Russian women who've paid a huge sum to arrange a visa into and work in the US, but on arrival the work has evaporated, replaced by instructions to meet an unknown man in a strip club. Not good. As the thread progresses, there are generous offers of help, expert advice, a terrible setback, and then... well, just read the thread.
