The _Other_ Taxpayers Alliance aims to counter the influence of [The Taxpayers Alliance](http://www.taxpayersalliance.com/ "You know, those folk quoted in every single news story on public spending"), that mysteriously-funded and very right-wing pressure group who claim to represent 'ordinary taxpayers', but are essentially a bunch of Thatcherite grandees with a big PR budget.
