For the past few years, I've made my daily cup of coffee with a cheap Vietnamese drip filter. They make a strong, rough-and-ready brew, are completely indestructable, wonderfully portable, and, in their own modest way, quite beautiful.

Not as beautiful as a [Chemex][1], though:

A shining example of what nobody calls 'mid-Century medical' design. Glass, wood, leather; that's it.


A few Chemex tips I've gleaned from the web and a week's use:

1. <strong>Wash your filter</strong>. This really does make a difference, even to my Benson & Hedges-blunted taste buds. Just pour a load of hot water through the filter, and pour it all out again--you don't even need to remove the filter to do this, thanks to the Chemex' pouring groove. (As a side-benefit, this warms the pot, tea-style.)
2. <strong>Mind your ratios</strong>. You'll need more coffee than you think if you're used to a cafeti√®re or Vietdripper. I've seen videos online where folk place their Chemex on a digital scale, adding milligram-precise amounts of coffee and water, and precisely time each step of the brewing process. More power to them, but I just go by a rough ratio of 60 grams to 1 litre of water. For my dinky Chemex model, that's about three healthy scoops of coffee to make a mugful.
3. <strong>Go easy on the water</strong>. First you need to dribble a small amount of water onto your grounds, and wait a bit for them to 'bloom'. Then drizzle on some more, all over the grounds, until the water level is almost at the top. Then wait until the coffee is not-quite-dry, and top it up again, pouring into the centre. Sounds fiddly, I know, but it's just three pours from the kettle.
4. <strong>Er, that's it</strong>. In three or four minutes, you've got a splendidly clear, zingy and fresh-tasting mug of coffee. Yum.
