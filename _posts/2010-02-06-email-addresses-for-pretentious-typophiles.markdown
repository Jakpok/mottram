Here's an idea: register the domain aroba.se, offer email addresses to mildly amuse typophiles (and, perhaps, the French); reserve arobase@aroba.se for personal use, amusement.

*Update*: I think it was [this piece](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n10/daniel-soar/short-cuts "Short Cuts") in the LRB that first alerted me to the word _aroabase_.
