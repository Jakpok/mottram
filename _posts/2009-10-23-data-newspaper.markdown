"We’ve been thinking about the beta Data.gov.uk repository, and wanted to explore putting some of the information contained within into people’s hands in a form that is accessible, timely, and relevant. And perhaps unsurprisingly, we thought a good way to do that was with a newspaper. So here it is, the _Postcode Paper_." Wonderful. I can't wait for [Newspaper Club][1] to launch, and have an idea for a hyper-local newspaper of my own brewing.
