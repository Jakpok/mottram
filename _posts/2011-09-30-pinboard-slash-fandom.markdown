It turns out that Delicious (or del.icio.us, as I insist on spelling it) was terribly popular with [fandom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom) types, especially the ones who enjoy [slash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_fiction) fiction. So, when the men who invented YouTube completely and utterly ruined the once-great service, breaking tags with a `/` in them in the process, the fandom people jumped ship--no [pun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping_(fandom)) intended--to Pinboard, a superior bookmarking service. Next, the fandom people set up a Google Doc so they could collaborate on feature requests to send to Maciej, the bloke who made Pinboard, and he, being a famously nice bloke, joined in, promising some new features and vetoing others. Finally, one of the fandom people wrote a piece of slash fiction about an anthropomorphised Pinboard lothario shagging an anthropomorphised fandom, making an anthropomorphised Delicious jealous. Amazing.


This is such a perfect storm of arcane web culture, pervy strangeness and general nerdery that I almost don't care that Pinboard's front page will, for the foreseeable future, be chock full of links to poorly-written short stories about, I dunno, Dumbledore copping off with Wesley Crusher while a an obscure manga character does a racist dance.
