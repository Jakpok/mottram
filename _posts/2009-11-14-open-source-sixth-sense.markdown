There are some jaw-dropping moments in this TED presentation about [SixthSense][1] a wearable device that projects information onto the real world, which the user can then manipulate using natural gestures--keep an eye out for the moment inventor Pranav Mistry takes a photo with the gadget.

I'm not sure about the wisdom of projection, though. Do we really want passers-by to see what we're layering onto the world? Probably not. Now that  Mistry has [open sourced][2] his project, I hope someone embeds this tech in a nice pair of <abbr>NHS</abbr> glasses!
