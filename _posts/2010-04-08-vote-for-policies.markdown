description: Take a policy-based survey to find the UK political party that matches your beliefs

Choose policies you favour, and find out which party matches your beliefs. The survey is limited to six parties--including two on the far right, but none to the left of the Greens, oddly--and very brief, omitting foreign policy entirely. (I'm mostly Green, and, surprisingly, they're the party in the lead after 50,000 surveys.)
