I always perk up when [a brand new text editor][2] appears for the Mac.

I'm pretty sure I've tried every single last text editor, and a fair few lightweight word processors, available on the platform since I first gave up fountain pens for a keyboard in 1995. I've even cobbled together a risibly basic editor of my own (thanks, [NSTextView][1]!).

When it comes to writing words, as opposed to HTML or CSS, here's what I look for in a text editor:

* Saving to plain text files
* A live word count

That's it, really. [Bean](http://www.bean-osx.com/Bean.html) and [WriteRoom](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom) do me nicely.

And so to [Ommwriter][2]. It's billed as an aide to concentration, a means by which we users might 'be at one with ourselves and our ideas'. A bit drippy-sounding, maybe, but it's hard to resist a new text editor, particularly one that touts its simplicity. So I downloaded Ommwriter, and I fired it up.

The thing plays ambient fucking music. It makes tippety-fucking-tappity typewriter noises. And it has a picture of a fucking tree where the background should be.

The cumulative effect is like trying to write while watching a [Borrower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Borrowers "Not that there's anything wrong with Borrowers; I wanted to be one when I was six") take tap dancing lessons on a frozen lake, with [RJDJ](http://rjdj.me/ "Essential audio-warping app") cranked up on its tiny fucking iPhone.

I am not joking, just look:

	<param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7670108&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=0&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff&amp;fullscreen=1" />
</object>

I'd like to think that the developers _are_ joking. I'd just love it if Ommwriter turned out to be a masterful piece of trolling, aimed squarely at the productivity fetishists, or those ostentatious, missing-the-point minimalists who drool over screenshots of their icon-free menu bars, functionality-be-damned. They require an email address before you download, and I honestly would not care a jot if mine ended up listed on a page full of fellow suckers under a ginormous blinking FAIL sign and a 960px-wide [facepalm.gif](http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=facepalm).

I could believe that, if the only evidence of Ommwriter were the video above. But the thing works, it's nicely polished--especially for a beta--and it's very good indeed at the horrible things it does. In fact, if you turn _everything_ off and drill down to the core of the application, I'm happy to admint that it's a thoroughly decent piece of writing software.

But those defaults? Lord, no. Here's what a text editor that lets you 'be at one' with what you're writing looks (and sounds) like:
