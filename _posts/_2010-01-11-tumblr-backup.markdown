There can't be many people in the world who take a keen interest in weblog application backup systems, but I thought this post from Marco Ament announcing the [Tumblr Backup application][1] was worthy of note:

> Unlike other publishing sites’ approach to backups, our goal was to create a useful copy of your blog’s content that can be viewed on any computer, burned to a CD, or hosted as an archive of static HTML files.

> Wherever possible, we use simple file formats. Our backup structure is optimized for Mac OS X’s Spotlight for searching and Quick Look for browsing, and we’ll try to use the same structure and achieve the same benefits on other platforms.

> Each post’s XML data, as specified by our [API][9], is embedded inside an easily-parsed-out HTML comment in each post’s HTML file, in case you want to do anything cool with it.

It's not the perfect way to do backups of a weblog and its data--though by combining the application with Tumblr's [XML or JSON output][], you could get pretty close--but it goes above and beyond the standard backup or export options provided by [Moveable Type][], [Wordpress][] <i>et al</i>, and shows that Tumblr have a had a proper think about the problem.

I hold some silly old-fashioned views about the way the web ought to work<sup id="r1">1</sup>, so I won't be using Tumblr anytime soon, but the more the fancy modern cloud-type applications take backup, export and interoperability seriously, the better.
