[Mapumental](http://mapumental.channel4.com/ "Mapumental") is a fascinating new project by [MySociety.org](http://mysociety.org "Everything they do is clever and useful") and [4iP](http://www.4ip.org.uk/ "Channel 4's public service digital media fund") that builds on MySociety.org's [earlier work on data mapping](http://www.mysociety.org/2007/more-travel-maps/).

Feed it a <abbr>UK</abbr> postcode, and it will generate an interactive [choropleth map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map "A choropleth map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map"), which lets you see locations highlighted by public transport commute times, house prices and 'scenicness'.

The service is in private beta at the moment. (My invitation arrived immediately after signing up, but the site is a wee bit slow, and prone to serving up error messages instead of maps--clearing cookies fixed everything for me, but your mileage may vary.)
