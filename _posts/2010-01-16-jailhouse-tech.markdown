A makeshift cooking stove, an example of what Kevin Kelly of Street Use has dubbed '[Jailhouse Tech](http://www.kk.org/streetuse/archives/2010/01/jailhouse_tech.php)'. More [examples](http://www.toxicocultura.com/blog/?p=1941), plus an interview with artist To&#241;o Vega Macotela.

See also: [Prisoners' Inventions](http://www.temporaryservices.org/pi_overview.html), recreated from diagrams by prisoner/artist Angelo, and [Escape Tools](http://www.marcsteinmetz.com/pages/fluchtstuecke/efluchtstuecke_minis.html), photographed by Marc Steinmetz.

I'm fascinated  by these objects in and of themselves, but also by the fact that, in all the examples I could find, it is _artists_ doing the documenting, and not just for the obvious, dubious, voyeuristic reasons.

Macotela's work is particularly good stuff, and was suggested by the prisioners--"We take normal objects and give them new meaning"--while he was engaged in a project to trade time and skills with them.

One prisoner showed Macotela how to kill a man with a shoelace, in return for Macotela teaching his daughter to read, another recorded his every heartbeat for three hours by marking a piece of paper, and Macotela cooked for the prisoner's family.
