NBR erected a paywall around their site last July, and lost readers to free competitors. Obviously, a specialist New Zealand-based publication isn't analagous to any of Murdoch's titles, but I wouldn't be surprised if similar graphs appear in the wake of News Corp's next foray into paid content. (Though it'll be interesting to see if paywalls around [content with a distinct local focus](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2009/nov/25/johnston-press-charging-for-content) fare any better.)
