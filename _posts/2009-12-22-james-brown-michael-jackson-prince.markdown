James Brown invites Michael Jackson to join him on stage. Jackson insists that Prince joins them. In other words: Best. Video. Ever.

Prince is really, &lt;housequake&gt;I mean <em>really</em>&lt;/housequake&gt; fucked up.

<p class="small">As if surrounding a Prince quote in pretend &lt;housequake&gt; tags wasn't sad enough, I'm now finding it hard to resist the idea of writing a DTD full of 'amusing' Prince references, unleashing PrinceML on the world. He'd probably <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/nov/07/musicnews.topstories3">sue me</a>, though.</p>
