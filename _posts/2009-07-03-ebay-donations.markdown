An interesting web-based alternative to [chugging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_fundraiser#Colloquial_Terms). I'd love to see some statistics beyond the running total of funds raised on the [MissionFish](http://www.missionfish.org/) website. Are people buying certain products more likely to donate? Does the amount spent on eBay effect the amount donated?
