I received an interesting email today, from someone who will remain anonymous (because Google tells me there's quite a few folk with the same name):

If you look at [the web page in question](http://submitresponse.co.uk/weblog/2008/11/23/todays-links-231108/), you'll see that I linked to the 'BNP Member Proximity Search', a handy service which lets you enter your Post Code and find out if any BNP members live in your neighbourhood.

It seems this BNP activist can't tell the difference between linking and publishing<sup id="r2-041511"><a href="#f2-041511">2</a></sup>, but it'll be interesting to see what the threatened 'further action' might be.

If you've received a similar mail, I'd love to [hear about it](mailto:j@ck.mottr.am)

_Update_: [Regulation 17](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/2013/regulation/17/made) of [The Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/2013/contents/made) appears to give a full defense in England and Wales for linking to another site's content--to borrow the regulation's rather nice phrase, by linking to another site I am acting as a 'mere conduit'.

_Update II_: More info [here](http://mottr.am/bnp2).

<p>That would be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Mosley_v_News_Group_Newspapers_Limited"><i>Max Mosley v News Group Newspapers Ltd.</i></a>: the one involving the News of the World's revelation that the son of a notorious fascist was paying prostitutes to act out S&amp;M fantasies that, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eady">The Hon.

<p>I did in fact sort-of-publish a subset of the BNP membership list back in 2008, on a page called <a href="http://submitresponse.co.uk/cats/"><i>A Small Compendium of Photographs of Cats Taken in the Vicinity of Fascists</i></a> which used the postcodes of Glasgwegian BNP members and the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr API</a> to--can you guess?--show photos of cats taken in the vicinity of fascists.<a href="#r2-041511">&#8617;</a></p>
