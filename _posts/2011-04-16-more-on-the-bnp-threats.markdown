Another day, another legal threat from... well, I'm not sure _who_ exactly, but someone who is very, very keen to scrub any traces of the leaked BNP membership list from the web.

You can read the [text of the second email](http://sprunge.us/NEYe) here--it's interesting reading, going into more detail than the [earlier threat](http://mottr.am/2011/04/15/bnp-membership-list-legal-threat/) about the legality or otherwise of linking to something that can't be published according to a court injunction.

Since my correspondent strikes me as the type to make my life difficult, I've temporarily taken the link to the BNP proximity search down, pending proper legal advice. If I'm advised that I'm legally in the clear, the link will be reinstated.

I should also point out that, while I despise the BNP, I support the court injunction prohibiting the publication of its membership list and of course believe that mouth-breathing racists have the same right to privacy as anyone else.

What I do object to is intimidation and threats, and to the idea that a hyperlink and accompanying text to can be considered against the law.

I don't want to get all poncey about journalistic freedoms when we're talking about a single link and a line of snarky commentary, but I should be able to freely report on the existence of something I find on the web.
