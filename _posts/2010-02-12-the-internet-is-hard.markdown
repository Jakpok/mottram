ReadWriteWeb on their earlier post [Facebook Wants to Be Your One True Login](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_wants_to_be_your_one_true_login.php), which--due to its high placement in Google searches for 'Facebook login' and a Facebook Connect button for signing comments--attracted hundreds of inexperienced users who thought the page _was_ Facebook. Back in September 2003, I wrote a [brief post](http://submitresponse.co.uk/weblog/2003/09/04/friendster/) about Friendster, which was attracting comments from confused Friendster users in need of help _as recently as January 2009_.
