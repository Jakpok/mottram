On [May 2nd, 2004][1], I pinged [the LazyWeb][4], asking someone to invent an application that would make my mobile 'phone ring, so that I could find it.

Five-and-a-bit years later, on June 17th 2009, Apple answered my call, releasing the wonderful [Find My iPhone][2] service. Nice one.

But, <a href="http://submitresponse.co.uk/weblog/2003/08/13/t610-on-the-desktop/">back in <em>2003</em></a>, my Sony Ericsson [t610][3] would display pop-up notifications on my Mac whenever I received a call, and even let me carry on SMS conversations from the computer, without so much as touching the 'phone:

As far as I can tell, six years later, my iPhone--which makes the t610, a great 'phone in its day, look like a relic of a bygone age--can't show me who's calling on my Mac, and won't let me chat via SMS from the comfort of my keyboard.

Perhaps I've missed something--the old Address Book Bluetooth features were [pretty obscure][5]. In which case: does anyone know how to bring the iPhone and <abbr>OS</abbr> 10.6 up to the standard set by the t610 and <abbr>OS</abbr> 10.2?

Having to walk across the room to answer a text message is just so 2002.

<p class="small">Lazyweb, I do hope the answer takes less than five years, this time!</p>
