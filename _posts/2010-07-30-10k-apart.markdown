A competition to build a web app in less than ten kilobytes, although you're allowed to cheat by using jQuery, Prototype and Typekit.

I can't quite believe it's been eight years since the last [The 5k](http://www.the5k.org/), the original, rather more rigorous competition (and the site which, in a roundabout way, led me to the Game Neverending, which had a chatroom with a photo-sharing feature, which eventually morphed into Flickr).
