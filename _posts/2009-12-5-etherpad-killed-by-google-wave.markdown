Google just bought AppJet, will shut down the brilliant [Etherpad](http://etherpad.com/ "Real time, web-based collaborative text editing"), and put the Etherpad team to work on the godawful stramash that is Google Wave. Check the comments on the aquisition announcement: Etherpad's collaborative real-time editing and chat was so well done that primary school teachers were using it with their pupils. If I were Google, I'd just chuck Wave out and stick a new logo on Etherpad.
