Google just bought AppJet, will shut down the brilliant [Etherpad](http://etherpad.com/ "Real time, web-based collaborative text editing"), and put the Etherpad team to work on the godawful stramash that is [Google Wave](https://wave.google.com/wave/ "Confusing as crikey"). Check the comments on the aquisition announcement: Etherpad's collaborative real-time editing and chat was so well done that _primary_ school teachers were using it with their pupils. If I were Google, I'd just chuck Wave out and stick a new logo on Etherpad.

**Update**: The howls of disappointment across the web have forced AppJet and Google to reconsider: [Etherpad will now remain online](http://etherpad.com/ep/blog/posts/etherpad-back-online-until-open-sourced), and the plan is to "open source the code to EtherPad and the underlying AppJet Web Framework".
