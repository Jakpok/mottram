This American Life is sort of a bit like FOOC--a radio show with short, factual stories told with a personal, usually wry perspective--only American, and so a bit cheesier. The new iPhone app lets you access the programme's archives, all the way back to the first show in 1995. Which, considering back episodes are 99&#162; a pop, makes it a bit of a bargain.
