Kevin Kelly is compiling a crowd-sourced compendium of great magazine journalism.

My contribution to the list is Hazlitt's typically acerbic ['On Common-Place Critics'](http://books.google.com/books?id=Pqw_AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA199&lpg=PA199), from _The Examiner_, 24th November, 1816.

It's one of my favourite nuggets of Hazlitt, but I had an ulterior motive in submitting it: the list is, understandably, skewed in favour of post-war US journalism, and I hoped to nudge contributors in different directions. Hasn't worked, yet--'On Common-Place Critics' is still the only piece on the list published prior to 1939--so if you're an expert in 18th Century periodicals, Little Magazines, fanzines or anglophone publications outwith the US and UK, get in touch with Kevin at the link above.
