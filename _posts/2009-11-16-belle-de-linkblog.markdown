I never gave Belle de Jour's weblog more than a cursory skim, but it turns out I used to read her non-pseudonymous link blog [methylsalicylate][1] after it was linked on [MetaFilter][2] (where she was an active member for a year or so), at a time when it was still kind of cool to happen upon [weblogs based in the UK][5].

Via [Link Machine Go][3], who made that MetaFilter post in the first place. Small world.

**Update**: LMG worked out that Belle de Jour was Brooke Magnanti [in 2004][4].

**Update II**: Parallax View [did too][6], and even linked to Dr. Magnanti in his [first post][7] about <abbr>BdJ</abbr>.

<p class="small">I'm starting to think I'm the only British citizen who had a weblog at the beginning of the decade who didn't guess the secret!</p>
