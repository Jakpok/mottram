Phil Gyford is making a news website, and I'm enjoying watching his plans unfold--initially intending to write summaries of the week's major stories, he's now thinking that what the news needs is [more context](http://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2010/02/02/news-week-2.php). A site that does to the news what Gyford's [Pepys' Diary](http://www.pepysdiary.com/) site does to, er, Pepys' Diary would be a wonderful thing.
