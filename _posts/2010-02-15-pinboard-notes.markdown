Pinboard now lets you 'bookmark' notes: paste in some text, add a title and some tags, and the service will provide you with a URL for your note. In other words, it's a bit like [Gist](http://gist.github.com/) with far fewer fancy features, and tied to your existing Pinboard bookmarks.

<p class="small">This means you could easily use Pinboard as the backend for a weblog. Not sure why you'd want to, but you could.</p>
