If you're running an old version of Wordpress, you might want to upgrade. Sharpish. 'Old' means anything prior to the current version, or the one before that, [according to Matt Mullenweg](http://wordpress.org/development/2009/09/keep-wordpress-secure/). It'll be interesting to see if folk jump ship over this. (Where to, I don't know--Movable Type is nice enough, but too much faff for folk used to Wordpress' 5-minute installs and automatic upgrades; and the other self-hosted options are geekier still.)
