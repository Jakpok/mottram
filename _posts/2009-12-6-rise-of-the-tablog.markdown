> The blog format has devolved. Once a simple gateway to self-publishing, today the blog format is responsible for a thousand tawdry tablogs: hideous half-breeds of tabloid and blog built around odious content, cluttered site designs, and optimised for pageviews alone.

_[Nick Cernis](http://putthingsoff.com/articles/rise-of-the-tablog/ "Rise of the Tablog")_

Amen. Nick concludes that we should abandon the weblog format altogether, replacing it with post-weblog services ([Posterous](http://posterous.com/), [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/) _et al._), social networks and specialised websites. 

I don't agree that the weblog format should be put out of its misery because it has been misused and debased, any more than I think painting ought to be outlawed because [Jack Vettriano](http://www.jackvettriano.com/ "Eugh.") or [Thomas Kincaid](http://www.thomaskinkade.com/magi/servlet/com.asucon.ebiz.home.web.tk.HomeServlet) commit their atrocities on canvas.

But--since portions of Nick's <del>weblog post</del> <ins>article</ins> read almost as a call to arms--I wonder if it's time for a [Dogme '95](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogme_95 "Dogme 95, Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg's film-making manifesto")-like manifesto for good old-fashioned anti-'tablog' webloggers?

Perhaps I'll write one.
