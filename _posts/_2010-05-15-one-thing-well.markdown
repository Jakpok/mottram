Last month, I got bored while making a web site, so I made another web site: [One Thing Well](http://onethingwell.org). It's all about simple, useful software, on any platform (though I've been a bit lax about Windows and Android), and people seem to quite like it. After ten years of weblogging, it's nice to know people are reading for once.

That readership isn't entirely my doing, and it's been interesting to watch the way a site can gain something of a readership. Most of this is down to people saying lovely things about, and linking to, the site, but a bit is down to the way Tumblr works, and the way it works with Twitter.

I didn't know much about Tumblr until I started One Thing Well, and gave up on Twitter once it stopped being a handy way to text several people at once for free. So this is all probably old news:

* Tumblr's stroke of genius is the reblog, a mechanism that lets folk instantly republish posts from the weblogs they read to their own weblogs. Reblogging is pretty contagious--once one person reblogs your post, at least one of their readers will reblog that reblog--and it seems to carry more weight than the 'via' link of weblogging tradition, or a Twitter retweet, so that if a popular Tumblr reblogs you, you get a sudden burst of new followers. Who may well start reblogging you, and so on.

* Tumblr encourages--I'm not sure how--community. Folk will email you, or use the Tumblr 'Submit' feature a _lot_. Enough that a site with a fairly narrow focus will begin to write itself thanks to all the suggestions from readers.

* It's impossible to know what kind of post will be popular, or who your audience is. My second most popular post is about a useful shell function, the most popular is about how to switch off the display on a Mac (which I only wrote to test the CSS for the `<kbd>` tag). Does this mean my readers are nerds who like tinkering with their `.zshrc` file, or that they're new to the Mac? Or both?

* Tumblr makes it easy to punt a link to a Twitter account every time you post, and _that's where the hits come from_.  

Patrick 'Minimal Mac' Rhone (who I've been chatting to for a few years about Mac stuff) got the ball rolling with a very kind post suggesting his audience might like my site, then Alex Payne (who I don't know at all) tweeted that 'nerds' would do well to check it out

The idea had been brewing for a while. I first thought (or, at least, first blogged) about doing a Linux version of Patrick's excellent Minimal Mac weblog last August, but never got around to it, mostly because I'm not a minimalist, and I've only been using Linux properly for three or four years.
