A MeFi post full of links to `vim` tutorials, tips and `vimrc`s, with more in the comments.

My interest is piqued, but I can't stop typing my [TextExpander](http://www.smileonmymac.com/TextExpander/ "Everything I type more than three times a week gets TextExpander'd") snippets or staring at the Terminal waiting for [TextMate](http://macromates.com/ "It's slogan, 'The missing editor' is starting to sound like a cruel joke, but I keep the faith") command key combinations to take effect. It feels a bit like that time I read the [Dvorak comic](http://dvzine.org/zine/ "It's persuasive!") after a bottle of wine, and spent two hours t...y...p...i...n...g very slowly.
