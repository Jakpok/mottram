Since shortened URLs are awfully popular, and URL-shortening services are [just awful](http://joshua.schachter.org/2009/04/on-url-shorteners.html), I thought I might as well provide dinky links for posts to this weblog.

On longer posts like this one, there's now a short URL up there under the title--it's [http://mottr.am/su](http://mottr.am/su) in this case--which you can copy into an email, or your Twittering application. Handily, the URL will be selected when you click on it. I've left them off links, photos and videos, since people will presumably prefer to link directly to the site or media in question.

<!-- If you happen to be a bookmarklet, a web service, or a piece of software, you can automatically discover the short URL for _any_ page on the site, whether you use <code>[rel="shorturl"](http://sites.google.com/a/snaplog.com/wiki/short_url)</code> or [<code>rev="canonical"</code>](http://shiflett.org/blog/2009/apr/save-the-internet-with-rev-canonical) to do your automatic discovering. -->

Quite why there's a continuing [web squabble](http://laughingmeme.org/2009/04/03/url-shortening-hinting/ "Thrilling stuff!") over the best method of autodiscovery for short URLS, I don't know--both are good, both have their shortcomings--but being forced into catering to two parties until one side wins out is ever-so-slightly irritating.
