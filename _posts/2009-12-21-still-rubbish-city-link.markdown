Google Analytics pinged me today, reporting a surge in traffic to a two-year-old post on my old weblog about [City Link](http://submitresponse.co.uk/weblog/2007/12/21/city-link/ "They messed me around in 2007"). It seems that, as Christmas draws near, the number of people searching for '[city link complaints](http://www.google.com/search?q=city+link+complaints)' (and similar, much ruder phrases!) rockets.
