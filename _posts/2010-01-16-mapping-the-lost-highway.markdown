Richard Kovitch reports on the Tate Modern's [Lynch symposium](http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/eventseducation/symposia/19702.htm "Mapping the Lost Highway: New Perspectives on David Lynch"), emphasising the futility of looking for meaning in the director's work (I'd agree, but add that it's fun to do so anyway) and his place in an American tradition that Roger Luckhurst calls 'the Weird' (Hawthorne, Lovecraft, Poe, &c.). Good stuff.
