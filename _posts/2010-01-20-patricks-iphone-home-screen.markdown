Patrick has revealed the results of his iPhone home screen experiment, which I [posted about the other day](/iphone)--interestingly, he uses Contacts as a conduit to other apps, and found that he only uses a small number of apps with any regularity. 

<p class="small">I realise this news may be of limited appeal, but I make no apologies for finding the way people use their gizmos fascinating!</p>
