[Buzz](http://www.google.com/buzz) is more than an ungainly cross between Twitter and [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/) that sits in your Gmail inbox: Google have just invented _glue_ for the web, a way of sticking together every last little thing we say, do, read and view online.

This is a good thing.

I've cheered from the sidelines as clever stuff like [microformats](http://microformats.org/), [OpenID](http://openid.net/), [PubSubHub](http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/), [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) and RESTful web APIs matured into the mainstream, and had rather hoped that these ideas would--somehow!--gather together to form an open, distributed, interoperable realtime commingling of all our off- and online activities, identities and relationships.

Buzz looks like it could be that '[somehow](http://code.google.com/apis/buzz/)'. It's just a bit of a shame that Google are doing the gluing, in order to flog more adverts<sup>1</sup>.

Still, better them than bloody Facebook.
