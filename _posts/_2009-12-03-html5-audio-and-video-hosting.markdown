HTML5's `<audio>` and `<video>` tags show a lot of promise, but at present both are a little bit fiddly to use.
	
When it comes to `<audio>`, you have to provide an `.ogg` file for Firefox 3.5 and above to play natively, an `.mp3` for Safari and Chrome/Chromium to play natively, and a Flash-based MP3 player for all other browsers (plus, if you're feeling completist, a `.wav` file for Opera).
	
The `<video>` tag requires even more faffing about, and again needs multiple files--`.mp4` and `.ogv` for native playback, plus a Flash player--if you want your video to work in the majority of browsers.
	
Implementing `<audio>` and `<video>` isn't that hard--for the former, you just have to serve the files in the correct order, for the latter, [Kroc Camen][1] has done all the hard work, as detailed in his excellent [Video for Everybody!][2] tutorial.
	
The hard, time-consuming part, for a casual weblogger with limited bandwidth and server space at least, is the file conversion and hosting.

The [Internet Archive]() will handily [convert uploaded video to Ogg Theora and H.264](http://internetarchive.wordpress.com/2008/11/25/rederiving-our-movies-to-ogg-theora-and-more/), and, since they allow embedding via more traditional methods, I doubt they'd mind folk serving video files from their servers. The only free, unlimited-bandwidth hosting platform I could find that both explicitly accepts both Ogg and MP3 files and allows hotlinking, but doesn't do any conversion is [MySpaceFileHosting](http://myspacefilehosting.com/).

The IA will only host a file you've created yourself, or that's in the public domain, and MySpaceFileHosting's [legalese](http://myspacefilehosting.com/Rules/)
