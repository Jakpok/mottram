Raoul Felix has made [jekyll](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) extensible, without modifying jekyll itself. Clever stuff. As a result, you can now browse this site by yearly and monthly archives--[/2010/](/2010/ "Archives for 2010"), [/2010/01/](/2010/01/ "Archives for January 2010")--or via tags, eg. [iphone](/tag/iphone/).
