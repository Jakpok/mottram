A competition to design a web app in less than ten kilobytes of code, though you can use external libraries, which is a bit of a swizz.

I can't believe it's been eight years since the last edition of [The 5k](http://www.the5k.org/), the original, rather more rigorous comp. that, in a roundabout way, introduced me to the Game Neverending, which had a chatroom with photo-sharing built in, a handy feature which eventually morphed into Flickr.
