Pros: Google Reader sync, in place of the godawful heap of poo that was Newsgator, which is to be taken outside and shot on August 31st. A nice 'send to [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/)' feature. Cons: very distracting, flickering, brightly-coloured advertisements (a paid-for version is coming soon, though). Synchronisation is a wee bit flakey.
