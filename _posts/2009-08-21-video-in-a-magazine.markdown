In the latest issue of _Entertainment Weekly_ magazine, there is _[a video advertisement](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/08/cbs-embeds-a-video-playing-ad-in-a-print-magazine/)_.

1. I bet people will do some really cool stuff with this free miniaturised video-playing hardware.
2. This is the first time something as eye-gougingly annoying as a web pop-up has appeared in a print publication; it won't be the last.
3. Can you imagine how cool the lyrics pages in _Smash Hits_ would've been with embedded music videos?
