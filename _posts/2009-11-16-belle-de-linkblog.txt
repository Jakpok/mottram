I never gave Belle de Jour's weblog more than a cursory skim, but it turns out I used to read her non-pseudonymous link blog [methylsalicylate][1] after it was linked on [MetaFilter][2] (where she was an active member for a year or so), at a time when it was still kind of cool to happen upon weblogs based in the UK.

Via [Link Machine Go][3], who made that MetaFilter post in the first place. Small world.
