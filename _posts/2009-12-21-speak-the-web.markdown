> Speak the Web is a series of small, intimate, low cost web design & development events in the style of a gig. We'll be coming to Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield and Leeds in early 2010.

Speakers include [Andy Clarke](http://forabeautifulweb.com), [Bruce Lawson](http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/), and [Simon Collison](http://colly.com/), a list that reads like a miniature 'Who's Who' of CSS3, HTML5 and ExpressionEngine experts, the three topics I've been reading up on most of late. (I'm not sure what 'in the style of a gig' means--I'm imagining a hall full of folk chanting for 'One more <del>tune</del> <ins><code>-webkit-transition</code></ins>' at the end.)
