Since fixing up my Eee PC, I've been trying out lightweight browsers--[conkeror](http://conkeror.org/ "Nice, but the emacs-style keybindings are a pain on the Eee"), [surf](http://surf.suckless.org/ "I really like surf, but I need to write some scripts to make it truly usable"), [uzbl](http://www.uzbl.org/ "Interesting, but too much faff")--that don't block adverts, so this hosts file has come in handy. I'll be sticking with browser plugins on the Mac, so I can easily whitelist the ad-supported sites I visit regularly, but if you're using a minimal browser, it's well worth a go.
