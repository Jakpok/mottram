> Unlike a conventional camera that captures a single plane of light, the Lytro camera captures the entire light field, which is all the light traveling in every direction in every point in space.

Which means you can focus <i>after</i> taking a picture. [Some example images](https://www.lytro.com/lytro-camera-launch/298), which you can click to re-focus.
