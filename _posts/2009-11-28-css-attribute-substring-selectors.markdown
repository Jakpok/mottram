Andy Clarke on styling images according to their filetype, file name, or `src` <abbr>URL</abbr> using <abbr>CSS</abbr> attribute substring selectors. Clever stuff--on this site I could strip three, maybe four presentational classes from my markup (though doing so would probably leave anyone not using recent versions of Firefox, Safari or Opera with unstyled images).
