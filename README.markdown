Hello, this is my jekyll-powered website, as seen at [http://mottr.am](http://mottr.am)

Feel free to have a look at the templates/CSS and pinch anything you like the look of (though I'd rather you didn't lift the site design whole). Novelty features: short URLs, commenting via Twitter hashtags. Thanks to [jekyll_ext](http://github.com/rfelix/jekyll_ext), the site now has tag pages and daily/monthly/yearly archives.
