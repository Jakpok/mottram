Hello, this is my jekyll-powered website, as seen at [http://mottr.am](http://mottr.am)

Feel free to have a look at the templates and pinch anything you like the look of. They're mostly pretty standard, aside from being in HTML 5. Novelty features: short URLs, commenting via Twitter hashtags, tags via pinboard.in.
