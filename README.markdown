Hello, this is my jekyll-powered website, as seen at [http://mottr.am](http://mottr.am)

 Novelty features: short URLs, commenting via Twitter hashtags. Thanks to [jekyll_ext](http://github.com/rfelix/jekyll_ext), the site now has tag pages and daily/monthly/yearly archives.

Feel free to use anything you like in terms of the structure, design and layout of the site, which is licensed under the MIT License (though if you plan to use the design in its entirity, please [drop me a line](http://mottr.am/contact/) first).
