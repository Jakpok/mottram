	<p>In the 80s and 90s, enterprising types would tour Ghanaian towns and villages armed with a generator, telly, VCR and a cache of VHS tapes, setting up temporary cinemas. To advertise their screenings, the touring picture palaces would display hand-painted posters, based on official materials, depicting scenes from the film in question, or inventively interpreting a film's title.</p>
